Switch applications to focus on productivity applications using AutoHotKey.

Prerequisite: Install [Autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/).
Prerequisite (optional): Own a Microsoft Natural Keyboard and install Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center.

Use case: Bind the AHK script to a function key on a Microsoft Favorites button.  When desired, tap the Favorite key to switch windows to the desired application.

Installation instructions for use case:
  1) Install both pre-requisites.
  2) Download the AHK scripts from this project to any designated folder on your computer.
  3) Click the Favority hotkey button to bring up the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center.
  4) For each respective hotkey, select Browse to select the desired script from the designated folder.

Tip: Modify AHK to select your own desired application.

Included are my favorite:
  a) Focus-ConferenceBrowser.ahk: Activates the Google Meet, Zoom, Whereby, Webex, Skype, Webex application in that order if it is already open.
  b) Focus-GoogleChatFocus.ahk: Activates Google Chat window (if not found, attempts to launch the Chrome Google Meet extension).
  c) Focus-Slack.ahk: Activates Slack window (if not found, attempts to launch Slack application).
